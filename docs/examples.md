# Examples

For consistency and clarity of the following examples, we're going to use a simplified dbt project. In practice, the model governance features describe are _most_ beneficial for large dbt projects that are struggling to scale. 

Let's imagine a dbt project with the following models:

TO DO: add DAG from example project here

## Component commands

### Create a new group

TO DO: add example here 

### Add/increment model versions

TO DO: add example here 

### Add contract(s)

TO DO: add example here 

## Global commands

## Group together a subset of models

TO DO: add example here 

## Split out a new subproject

TO DO: add example here 

## Connect multiple dbt projects

TO DO: add example here
